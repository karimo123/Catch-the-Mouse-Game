# Catch-the-Mouse-Game
A game made in java done as an assignment in the first year of my program. The purpose is to catch the mouse before it escapes.

How to play. Download the Files to a folder. Then run the CubesGame file in terminal.
On mac go to the directory the files are in. For example if they're in the desktop then do this.
cd desktop
javac CubesGame.java
java CubesGame 8

Thats it, then the game will start. The number 8 can be changed into any number between 4-20. This determines the size of the board.
The mouse can only be caught by clicking on it when its next to a snake. If it is not next to a snake, then you must click on an emtpy box next to a snake.
This empty box next to a snake wil then become a snake, and the mouse will randomly move on the board. If the mouse moves to any empty boxes on the outside of the board, then it wins! 

Those are the rules
